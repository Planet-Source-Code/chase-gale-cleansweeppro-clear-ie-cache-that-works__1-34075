## CleanSweepPro \- Clear IE Cache that WORKS\!

### Description

CleanSweepPro uses the Win32 API (WinInet.dll) to enumerate all entries in the URL Cache and then remove them. THIS WORKS! I made this because I was really tired with all the non-working 'Clear Your Steps' type programs that only worked on Windows 95. Read the 'about..' section if you have questions/problems. This is a good example of OOP, Win32 API, WinInet, and more! Enjoy!
 
### More Info
 
Notta

A message if your cache is cleared.

You will lose your IE cache.
